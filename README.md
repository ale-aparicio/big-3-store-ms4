### Wireframes

Wireframes were made to have a clearer vision of how the website would look like. Note that the wireframe was the first vision of the website and does not reflect the current design of the website as many changes have been made due to feedback from the developer's mentor and other outside feedback such as family and friends.

![Wireframe of the website]()

### Design Choices 

#### Fonts 

[Emblema One](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Emblema+One?q) was used for the logo.

[Rowdies](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Rowdies?query=Rowdies) was used as the main font throughout the website 

The developer chose to only use two fonts as it will be easy to manage and keep the fonts consistent throughout the website. 

#### Colors 

A light simple theme has been chosen for the websit, as you can see this varies massively form the wireframes due to feedback from the developer's mentor, as the wireframes looked like old early 90's websites and it was better to go for a more minimalistic modern look. This compliments greatly as there is no target age demographic and the site expects to recieve visits from all age groups.

## Structure

### Information Architecture
[Heroku PostgreSQL](https://www.heroku.com/postgres) is used to host the back-end database for the site.

The shops code base has been developed using the **Django** framework, and is made out of the following **Django** apps:

- Home
- Products
- Bag
- Checkout
- Profiles

### Home Models - 
The **Home Model** is simply used to display the home page of the website. It is the first thing User's see when navigating thorough the website so it connects all the models together in one page. 

### Products Models - 

**Product** is split up into different sections: 

- **All Products** - is used to display all the products available despite their categorization. This section can be accessed through the home page.

### Checkout Module - 

The **Checkout** module is used to display and input a users information and credit information in order to make a payment. It is essential that all the information is secured as it is very sensitive and private information.

The profiles app is used to allow the user to not only access their own informatin aswell as past order history but also to allow registered users to access specific features such as the Review Forms. The Profiles Form allows the user to save and edit their personal information.

### Design Changes 

After a conversation with my mentor the entire design of the website was changed from the original wireframe design to a more simple, modern look due to the wireframe design looking old and outdated. 

The colors have been simplified to a black and white with a grey background rather than using shades of blue and orange for the design of the website. 

The overall structure of the website has been changed a little to make it have a more modern look and feel to it
some of the more noticeable changes are to the Cart, Checkout. 

Cart has been slightly changed to accomodate extra functionalities and pieces of information aswell as simplify the design to make it more sleek and appealing to the eye. 

The Checkout page has just been simplified and we have added a few more form entries needed for the checkout process to be complete. 

## Testing 

Testing information can be found in the [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) file. 

## Deployment 

The project has been developed using **Gitpod** and **Github**. The project had regular commits to **Github** throughout the development of the site. 

The website has been deployed using **Heroku** with the help of **Amazon Web Services** to store the static and media files.

In order to make a Fork or Clone of the project, a GitHub account is required. The Gitpod Browser Extension is also recommended.

## Credits 
-  [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com) for the incredible help whenever something was not working as it should. 

- [Richard Henyash's](https://github.com/richardhenyash/perkulater) [Perkulator](https://perkulater.herokuapp.com) project. I replicated his review feature since I really liked the star system and the way he had his reviews setup was really appealing and thought it was very well executed. I discovered his project scrolling through the peer-code-review section in slack while looking for inspiration on features.

- Thanks to my mentor **Oluwaseun Owonikoko** for her incredible help and advice.
